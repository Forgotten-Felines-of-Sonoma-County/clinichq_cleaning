I said no but we need our equipment back if you're not actively trapping. She asked when she could get in I said Jan 09 and she busted out laughing. She said she will bring traps back on Monday and will pick some up closer to the date. I'm betting good money all of this will not happen.

She flipped over the price. I explained that we don't negotiate on the fee for tame cats as we have the lowest cost around and have special protocol for the tames. I also explained that when she spoke to Shannon, Shannon probably didn't realize she was bringing in tame cats and I apologized for that mistake. She wanted to speak to my superior. I hung up after minutes of listening to her ranting and nastiness. She called back and spoke to Mary reiterated what I told her and let her know when you would return.\n3/9/16 NC - Instructed Shannon to call Christine back and to let her know that we will require advance payment in the future. \n3/9/16 SC - she called this morning. did not bring cats because she has no money. told her we needed a call yesterday, not after clinic had already started. rescheduled the cats 1 at a time, more affordable, 3/16, 3/23, 3/30 $15.00 a piece.\n3/2/16 NC: Called to confirm she had two cats for our clinic today. Then was NO SHOW! I called her in the afternoon to check out why she didn't show. She said her son let the cats out of the carriers. I explained that it would have been nice to know. Rescheduled for 3/9 clinic for 3 TAME cats and told her the charge is $50. Her first words when I called was that she wants us to take the female. I explained that I can provide spay/neuter services only.\n2/26/16 SKS: Christine Perez (not to be confused with Christina Perez, our lovely foster mom), has 4 semi-tame cats she feeds. She can pick them up and put them in carriers. We scheduled the first 2 for 3/2/16. I spent a lot of time explaining things to her on the phone, but she sounded like she was on ****, talking at a super-high rate of speed, and I will be very surprised if she absorbed all of my instructions correctly. I would place my bet on her getting things wrong. I emailed everything to her roommate, since Christine does not have email. Process all as feral w/eartips. Paying $30.",

Because of their age, we are going to process them as feral kittens with a small ear tip. If she is successful, she will find them homes, but if not, they'll have their ear tip. These kittens are already in her possession, so I told her we would consider them CONFIRMED appointments. She will bring the kittens in their crates to clinic.

Client will use two traps and one carrier for smallest kitten. Kittens are approx 6 mos. old. Will release back to creek area.\n04/28/16.MP.Trappers Valerie, David and Ellen. TNR's 4 adults and yanked 3 kittens. There are at least 4 litters total. The neighbor on the other side is Scott Chesnut 849-4371 #534. He's a weasel too.\n04/26/16.MP.Creepy Chuck just called,538-0928. Said neighbors moved and abandoned the cats and wife started feeding. She's a teacher. I guess she's not smart enough to realize the outcome of not altering. He said I could take kittens and adult cats. Isn't he nice. Said his wife can't see the trappers or hear them. Good lord. This ought to be fun. Oh and he can only be contacted when his wife if gone so 8-3 30 pm.\n04/25/16.JK communicated with Rolf on Nextdoor. His neighbor Chuck and wife feed many, many cats but do not get them altered. Rolf bragged to JK that he trapped and brought to Co. 30+ cats. Other neighbor Scott Chesnut is an oddball but is willing to help us out. He has 4 cats of his own. There are 4 litters that we know of already. Valerie and David with the help of Ellen are going to tackle this. Rolf's number is 537-7969. Scott's number is 849-4371. MC to FFSC.04/16. Rolf and Chuck's neighbor. Kind of a **** but let us trap on his property. His number is 707 849-4371.",

A nice woman named Sharon about an igloo and trap that is outside her work 1301 Redwood Way. Pet. She is very thankful and wants to offer help to Melva in any way she can. Her number is 794-9930. I passed on the information to Melva. \n7/5/18 SKS: Received an email from a Daniella working for Cornerstone something or other. Said their clients were moving in to the new facility at 5400 O.R.H., where they would be processing food, and the cats had to go because it was a health hazard. I emailed her back to let her know FFSC doesn't do removal, just TNR. AND, that the cats' presence would be a BENEFIT to a food processing facility, because they would keep the rats at bay! Haven't heard back from her yet. Apparently Melva went and introduced herself to the clients, saying she comes out and feeds every once in a while, and that she is \"with Forgotten Felines.\" Uh huh. Yup. Hopefully it can be resolved with feeding the cats in a new location.\n05/31/18. MP. This **** took the two cats directly to PAS and gave them a song and dance. Kathy Sousa said new shelter manager said we'll relocate them somewhere where there is an existing colony. WHAT!!!!! I do believe dumping is illegal. Jesus H. Christ. Kathy reached out to us thank ****. I filled her in that Melva is delusional. There will be construction but surrounded by fields I told her cats should go back. She will return immediately.\n05/29/18. MP.. Looks like I haven't updated in awhile. The has roped Lesley Cowley into doing the trapping. Bless Lesley's heart she does. This time called about a cat with an eye injury. Lesley went out and of course said oh by the way a missing \"fire cat\" from araa motel has been spotted here. Lesley got the \"fire cat\" but no the injured cat. And you guessed it it wasn't this person's cat. Melva says it's a pregnant female and tame. She wants to work with her. Lesley is holding her and will bring her to clinic. Will process with no ear tip. \n01/06/15.MP.Lesley C. has been assisting Melva. Melva requested an appt. for this clinic and then flaked on Lesley. She sent NC a nasty email sooooo no more trapping asst. for her. She has to call me directly to book a future appt. and if she doesn't adhere to our protocol then I will ask she find another S/N option.\n07/13/15.MP.Been a client since 08/13. She feeds a colony at Adobe Lumber in Petaluma. FLAKEY!!!! She and her husband Dennis. We helped her out last year. Lesley C. was her trapper. Melva calls and says she has kittens. Oh yes of course she does. Wanted Lesley's help but I said no out of town and not enough trappers to go around. Melva will trap on her own.

MP. From Jami. She TNR'd eleven cats and still feeds them as a colony on her property. She was walking her dog and discovered that a neighbor two doors down and across the street was feeding two cats in an abandoned house at this address.\nShe is going to be trapping and bringing them into clinic, but she does not want them released back to property even though the neighbor across the street who has been feeding them will still feed them.\nShe does not want them integrated into her colony, she says the people that are going to move into the empty house will have dogs, and she does not want to come back and pick them up at the end of the day. \nI gave her the speech, she is adamant, so we may have to release them back ourselves.

Said they already have one of our traps and wanted a 2nd because they are trapping in two separate places. When I pulled the equipment rental form, I saw that they are signed out for two traps. When I inquired to her, she said they returned one of them. Upon further investigation found that they are trying to re-trap the mother cat that has already been altered by us cause there is someone who \"wants\" her. I asked her if they knew what they were doing and did they have a place to do a successful relo and she said they downloaded the instructions from our site and \"thought\" that this person would do the right thing. I explained that this was VERY important and that just \"relocating\" a cat is against the law because it is inhumane. So they are using our trap to try to re-trap their moma cat and want a 2nd trap to trap at their neighbor's house who also has feral cat/kittens there. One has already been hit by a car. We have no traps available now, but I told her we would try to find a \"feeder\" trap for the second location. She wants two appointments for 8/24 for the neighbor's kitties.\n7/25/2016 JK: No notes prior to today, although client was in system and has brought cats to clinic????? Claimed he had brought in a kitten last week that was too young to alter (7/20/2016) and was calling to make an appointment for that kitten, however upon talking to him, he still has adults to trap as well. Asked if we would make two appts. and I told him to bring the adults BEFORE he brings in the kitten as they are the priority. He will bring in the kitten (was told to wait two weeks before bringing it in again) as a \"fill in\" should **** unsuccessful in trapping.

We all know that is a load of **** so I asked Julie Z to start out there. It's right down the street.\n10/28/14.MP. So I went out to check out Hunter Lane. I think the two colonies are co mingling and ground zero was Andrea Williams @780. I am relocating all 8 ish of the cats at Andrea's. Something is not quite right w/Andrea and she stopped feeding months ago because Co. said to stop and the cats would go away. I'm assigning a trapper to Wendy's property. Wendy feeds and is OK w/TNR. She's a whacky but nice.\n8/8/14 SKS: Wendy called regarding neighbor down the street who has large colony of unfixed cats on their property. They are the source of all the ones that end up on Richard's property. According to Wendy, Animal Control came out 15 years ago when this was a huge problem and took all the cats away. Now it's starting up again. She doesn't want to keep \"cleaning up their mess\" by trapping cats that end up on her son\n7/18/14 SKS: Wendy Bruce is Richard's mother, and she is managing the TNR at his property. Her #: 570-5840. She will try for one cat, two might go into the trap together. She has one trap, says it is malfunctioning, wanted to borrow from us, but we were out of traps. She will bring her trap in for us to look at, perhaps it is fixable, or she can use it as a string trap.10/14. Trapper Mary P.This was a convoluted colony. Many players that were less than human.

She finally decided to bring him to her vet to have him checked out, and when they scanned him, they found her, and they have been reunited. The cat is healthy, well fed, received a rabies shot by the vet. She called to thank us profusely for all of our help, to talk about the miracle of a microchip, closure for the family, and early Christmas gift getting him back. He was gone for five years. She also gave an update on the two barn cats they adopted to let us know they are doing very well and are very loved. \n09/18/20. MP.

We tried contacted her ex as she left no contact info to say the cat must belong to someone as it was TOTALLY tame and fixed and in excellent shape. No word from her until clinic Wed. a.m.message call stating she wanted cat examined, tested, vaccinated, treated for parasites and give a clean bill of health. She did not pick up cat and called Wednesday night leaving message.

She thought it might be a hairball but she put out butter for them? She was afraid it had something that it may give the other cats. I told her my next clinic would be on Wed 3/21 but that if it seemed serious she shouldn't wait that long. Recommended she call around to vets in the area and either get her seen or get their opinions on if she can try something else over the counter. I told her if she doesn't get any results from this in the next few days to give us a call back and we can schedule her for a wellness though it may not be something we can tackle here. \n1/31/18 jC: three tame kittens dropped off on property.

Aaron knows he can trap Mom because she's hanging around the laundry room. He will find homes for kittens and have them fixed elsewhere as to not use our services for tame kitties.The Dad cat is his OWN cat!!! He is going to use La Plaza to book his appt. ASAP\n9/1/17 DF: 2 cats went to LaPlaza for alter, both males, DSH Brn Tabbies, one was Aaron Karres and one from Carole Petersen, near Locatem colony. Chip number 981020015833068 was place on both cat waivers so it is unknown which cat rec'd that chip. We have no record of what chip was placed in the other cat. So we are cross-referencing. If cat gets turned in somewhere, we will be notified and can figure out where cat belongs. Luckily, one cat is from West side of Petaluma and the other is from East side of Petaluma. Both cats will be registered to FFSC so if contacted we can figure out where cat belongs.\n01/09/19. MP. Talked to Meg about trapping a cat. She was doing everything wrong. Gave her lot's of information hopefully it will work  Very nice.\n****/2015: JK Meg's daughter-in-law e-mailed me about Meg....she has a stray - thinks it is pg - doesn't want to abort - what should they do? I called Meg, a long time supporter of ours, and told her it was the best thing to do and that getting kitty in here ASAP was important. She agreed. Has a trap of her own - will feed out of trap until Tuesday night, then set and hopefully capture. She has 8 cats of her own who haven't welcomed this little girl, but they all come in at night and Meg will continue to feed this girl and care for her.....hopefully once she is fixed, her cats will accept her. There may also be a chance this cat is tame. (Sounds like it to me.) 707-576-7150",

The older kitty I took in when my friends father passed away has one of her nails growing into the pad of her foot. No wonder she’s so ornery! She is not spayed and I doubt she’s ever had shots or had her nails trimmed. She was always an inside cat and no longer goes into heat. It seems dangerous at this point to spay her but I just noticed her nail growing into her paw. I’ve been trying to drug her with gabapentin to cut her nails but she won’**** enough of the wet food to get docile. I am now to the point where I can pet her head a few times before she swipes me but there is no way I can clip her nails or dislodge the one from her paw. Is that something you guys could do at clinic? If not no worries at all and I’ll try and get her into a Sebastopol vet. I for sure need someone experienced with ferocious kitties 😬01/19.

SKS & Annabel, Robin S., and even a couple of residents have trapped cats there and either brought to us, or took to SCAS. Unfortunately I don't know any of the names it was under before, so although this location is in CHQ somewhere other than this, w/o names I can't look them up. Caitlin is an employee who wants to TNR 2 older kittens + 2 younger kittens. Of course, we know there is a mom, too. I told her about feeding out of the trap prior to actually trapping, and she agreed to do it. It's very possible that mom will show up when an obvious source of food presents itself. She is renting traps from Western Farm Center, and wanted two slots for the next clinic. 8/1 is way overbooked, so I scheduled her for 8/8 and emailed her the info.707-538-8400",

They don't want to upset the teas kettle. Is that a saying???? They saw 5 very preggers cats within 5 minutes. \n04/18/19. MP. He has been bringing cats in every week. Had one girl pass away after surgery.\n4/5/19 JC: We may have a convert here! Richard owns a Dairy in Bodega, over the years cats and kittens have died from a virus, but that's no longer happening. He's got several females who are very pregnant now. Trying for those first. He first asked if we \"come and take ferals and put them somewhere else\" and laughed about shooting certain tomcats. At the end of the conversation he thanked me for our help. Hence, the $10 fee since he wanted to pay nothing.",

She called today because she has three generations of cats on the property that need to be TNR'd. She did not identify herself as Lynn Spaletta's daughter-in-law. She just described herself as a person that lives on a rural property that needs to get nine female kittens spayed. As more questions were asked, more answers came. Many cats, inside and outside, unknown sexes of them all. When asked where the mama cat was of these kittens, she said it is somewhere on the property. When asked if they needed to be trapped, she said there are too many to keep track of. There are three generations, and she is just trying to make sure these kittens don't have kittens.

She stepped up and is going to do it. I told her I need her neighbor's contact information to sign her up. Well low and behold it was Lynn.

Got a call from Shaun on Wednesday, before the fires in 2017 he and his wife had closed their pet store and donated a trailer full of cat food to us. So he called using that as leverage to get these cats altered. Mama cat with 4 kittens, they are keeping two and will find homes for the other two. I didn't get back to him right away, and he called today and said that he was a little \"perturbed\" by that. Ha, you can go to SHS then! He will bring in all 5 next week, $50 each. Then he tells me he used to trap at the movie theatre on Airport Blvd, and he would set the traps at 5 and come back around 10pm. I of course told him this was not ok, do not leave the traps unattended and the whole thing. He was so surprised by this claiming he had no idea. I'm not sure with all their history how this is possible. Then he talks about setting up cameras which are linked to their computers and that way they would come when they see the cats in the traps. He really doesn't want to just be there apparently. Ok rant over, don't like him. \n8/12/15 NC: Shaun (creep) brought in an already altered tortie that got into his car up at the lake off Fountaingrove and assumed it was feral. It was an already altered female. We made posters and insisted he put them up. Monday, 8/17 we received a call from Lee at 235-7421 who saw the posters and knows the cat and her owner. The owner is a man in a van who is up at the lake on a regular basis. Lee will watch for him and will let him know to call us so we can reunite. I have called Sally and let her know to hold on to the cat as there is an owner. \n7/31/15 SKS: Picked up another stray F, thought she was pg, wanted to let her have the kittens (!!!).

She is semi-tame, friendly but does NOT like to be picked up -- will come in a trap. Scheduled for 8/12/15.\n6/15/15 NC: Now boyfriend, Shaun Hackett called back. Wants to know why we won't alter the kittens once they are born. Explained that the clinics will be full in two months and they could get them done faster via the HS. Said they also have ferals that they will be trapping. Said they know all about this process, though he said they would be trapping on Friday and would call for an appointment after they trap cats. KNOW IT ALL.\n6/15/15 NC: Called to remind client of appointment. Client says cat is ready to pop and would prefer she have kittens and to find a home for them. Owns Pet store where she can adopt them out and sell them. Told her to see private vet or Humane Society to alter mom. Sounds like this is the second time she has opted for the litter to be born. Last time she said she just took the 12 kittens to her store and found homes.\n6/11/15 NC: Old FFSC client who has a cat that has appeared on property.

Both have tapeworms, and are still outside cats she is trying to make inside cats. Client is good hearted but insane. Regina lives in apt. 161. MP. She sttated below that these two cats were kittens when she found them in the bushes in 11/22. Not correct I brought them in 11/03/22 to get them fixed and they were both 11 pounds.\n09/08/23 JK Two adult apartment complex cats found in bushes at complex as small kittens in 11/2022. Client and others have been feeding the cats since. Client has committed to bringing the cats into her apartment during the day wherein they have destroyed her carpeting and interior as they do not like to use a litter box, and they do not like to be confined. Client sleeps during the day with the cats inside and stays up all night as she lets them out at end of day and follows them around complex at night. To what end I am at a loss, but apparently part of the process is to let them defecate in the great outdoors. Client was informed by her landlord that she has thirty days to figure this out. Client will pick up two traps to bring cats to clinic. $50.00 OK Ear tip OK.This is for Anne. 08/22/19. MP. She called today about a community cat at an apartment complex down the road from her. She heard about him through a Nextdoor conversation. Many people say he's not owned by anyone but everyone cares for him. They also say he's a nuisance why???? because he's un neutered. She wants to find him a new home. I explained this might not be the best thing for this fella. Why don't you wait and see. Get him neutered and then put him back out and check with neighbors and see if he is still a nuisance. If they say yes then she will be ahead of the game in trying to find him a new home. Again very nice lady and gets the process. $30.  415-515-5577.",

She knows Roberta who feeds in the morning and says she is the one who feeds at night. Feeding 9-Lives Dry food. She's going to send me a photo of fresh ****.\n10/29/20. MP. From Jami. Trapper Lesley Cowley. We moved into 2616 Giffen Ave exactly 2 years ago. Saw a few feral cats. Heard there was a Cat Lady next door. I had thrown some crumbs out for the birds and a kitty came and was eating them! And she had a huge wound in her chest. I figured she was starving and since we have two indoor cats I gave her a little food. Lesson learned. Contacted your office and tried at least 2 maybe 3 times to catch some but no luck and I gave up.This year 3 litters. 15 kittens And then there are all the cats next door at 2610 - The Cat Lady. Neighbors let me know this has been an issue for years and Forgotten Felines had been called in the past. A woman named Kathy was working with your office and she had been feeding all the cats at 2610 Giffen. She was moving and asked if I would take over. Another mistake. I'm 65 and on Social Security and now can't afford to feed all these cats. There must be at least 20-30 cats that I have seen. Who knows how many more there are. A neighbor told me there's another litter at 2606 Giffen now. Last straw was 2 days ago when a kitty was stuck on barbed wire. I could not get it off. This is something I will never be able to get out of my head and I'm beyond upset about it. Called my vets office who pulled some strings and I had Animal Control here pretty quickly. \n6/5/2019 JK: Was scheduled for today. Was unsuccessful - Said she would return traps as she won't be around next week.\n5/24/19 BRS Roberta called - just moved to this new house 6 months ago. Cat has shown up, she has been feeding it. There is a large mass on its chest that is bleeding. Coming by today (28th) to get a trap. She was hoping we would send someone out . There is also another kitty she says is now hanging out, so I am gonna give her another trap just in case. 2 appts. tomorrow\n01/23/17.MP entered into system.

Alana has done 32 cats so far. We have determined that there is Calici going around this colony.\n1/23/20- bb Shane is concerned because 4 other cats recently altered are showing the same signs as the girl she brought in earlier. We have had no signs of other cats from different clients having these symptoms. I explained that we really don't know what is causing it, but the doctor felt that the stress of anesthesia triggered something latent (likely a virus). If it is a virus, it will more than likely run it's course. Advised to wait/watch and keep them as warm and safe as possible)\n01/21/20. MP ALna has brought 15 cats in so far. We pulled 2 older kittens but the property owner said if one isn't returned he will shoot the other cats. I guess the 30 other tame cats just don't do it for him. We had to take the cat out of Foster care and return. She also brought in a cat she she was limping and extremely lethargic since the spay. Bita brought her to Pet Care. Dr. Beth couldn't find anything really wrong. She's on Clavamox here at the office to err on the side of caution.\n01/05/20. MP. These two seem normal but they're not. Nice enough and occasionally feed but sketchy. Alana Lavery is going to trap out there. Do not sign out traps to them in future unless get cash deposit. Shane rents there and says there are 40+ cats. Got her all set up months ago after her dramatic act in the lobby. She has 3 traps and only brought in 1 tame cat. She sent someone else to pickup the cat. I believe so she wouldn't have to pay anything. I have left numerous messages for her and finally she answered the phone yesterday. I asked Alana Lavery is she would trap and she said yes.\n9/30/19 BRS Got a call about a week ago from a woman named Tina that lives on this same property. She has a kitten that went missing. Tom is her boyfriend, and he is the owner of the property, it's a Christmas Tree Farm. Tina's phone # is 707.624.5382\n8/29/19 NH: Nice woman called in a panic about \"20 to 30 possible cats\" out on a property off Gravenstein Hwy N. Was very grateful for any/all help and willing to pay the $30 per cat it sounds like. Got her appts for most of Sept 2019",

She blew off picking up kitten or her 2 other cats we altered. She barges in Tuesday morning **** that we had the cats so long. We all tried to get the kitten off her. I explained she needs to keep him confined and hardly any movement. The first thing she does is whip him out, flip him on his back and rub his belly. The kitten was in utter shock from the pain. Never made a peep. I called later that afternoon and she starting crying saying come get him. I ran over there to pick him up. Her camp is in the back of the vacant lot. There are 10 cats total. All as of today are S/N. She kept going back and forth about relinquishing the kitten. Finally it happened. Dr. Beth came in a little early to examine and ended up euthanizing him.

He is semi-tame and ended up urinating blood. She got concerned and took him into petcare east afterhours, they assessed (for $700 over 2 visits) that he has crystals in his **** and most likely a urinary infection. She started him on the crystal prevention food they recommended. She said she has cancer herself and so money is somewhat of an issue but she really wants to do what's best for him. She called again today to give me an update and said that he had gotten out of the house for a few days about a week ago but has since come back and mainly prefers to stay indoors now.

Not a cat in sight nor any bowls. I canvassed the are but no one home until Angel pulled up. He and his girlfriend live in the front house and his Mom and Dad live in the nice trailer inthe back. Both very nice. He brought his Dad up front. He too was very nice. He said we don't have a lot of cats just one unneutered male. I said well we can fix the fella. He said he would talk to his wife. Ken said Scott and his wife that live on the back side of them are the ones that told Ken there are oodles of cats and not thrilled about the cats pooing in their yard. I said if this is the case then let's trap at their property. He said they don't want to get involved because those people are very mean. Same old ****.

One escaped at her home when the back door fell open accidentally. She came to office with one very feral kitten, approx. 9 weeks old. Very feral. I told her that the kitten was too old to start the taming process, and she should just clean the litter box and give food and water, and bring the kitten to 11/18/15 clinic IN THE CAGE.

She is not in HQ and would not give me her exact address address, but I googled her and she lives at 5560 Henning Road in Sebastopol. Her phone number is 707-529-7674. It is a rural property with a barn, fields, and her mother (Margot) lives on the same street (googled that too). She is calling because there were five owned cats on her property before the pandemic, and now there are approximately four males and 20 females. I asked her how many kittens there were, and she said \"scores\". She has found homes for eleven of them. Some she has brought to the Humane Society. They are mostly black cats. She says she looks out her window and sees a sea of cats. Where this gets tricky is that she will not answer if they are tame or not, she feels they were abandoned during the shut down, and she goes out and feeds them twice a day. They all come up to her. She is not sure if she has traps because they share traps with the neighbors and she needs to check in the barn. This information came about because she was calling to see if it was OK to give a kitten younger than eight weeks flea medication, NOT BECAUSE SHE HAD A CAT PROBLEM. I asked if they had shelter, and she said she usually finds a mama cat in the barn with a litter of kittens. They run through the fields. She is quick to complain about how much she feeds them, but very resistant to have any help. She said she doesn't want anyone on her property. I gave her information about s/n for tame cats, also s/n information about wild cats, so I don't really know where to go with this except to report it to you. I reached out to her and she is a little paranoid and finally made headway with her. I offered her trapping assistance and might take it affter she brings in the cats she can handle first. I will work on possibly relocating some. She said she brought a litter of kittens to County that had to be euthanized. She lives right next door to a recent, active FeLV positive colony so think this may be ground zero. We will test all but didn't talk to her about it because think she would drop off the radar. So we will have to take it one day at a time. I have her scheduled and waiting back to see if she will bring them in. 707 529 7674.\n.",

She called the Sonoma County Animal Services and they said the cat was too \"feral' for them to accept. That lead her to us and here is the info: She lives at 7790 Highway 1, eight miles north of Bodega Bay. The good news is that she lives across the street from the ranger's office and they gave her a trap. She is feeding the mama cat, who mostly goes underneath her greenhouse. She would like to get the cat in as soon as possible before she has her kittens. The mama has been around for about three weeks. She can get about two feet from her, and she takes off. She does not want much to do with people - but is consistent in coming in to get fed. She is young, and in good health with no injuries. Marlene can arrange to get mama cat into us once she is trapped. She just needs plan and a date. I have her booked and she is very nice. $30. 707 484-7011/875 2161",

You had been helping me with getting a tricky-to-trap adult female and her kittens altered and I had to drop the ball for a while. Now 1 of the kittens has stayed on the property and I haven't seen the other for over a month. However, I finally am able to get back to this and am hoping we can get the 2 cats scheduled for surgery next Monday and Wednesday (in case I can't catch them the first day). \n.07/28/20. MP. From Bridget. Hello, My name is Alana Palmer. I left a voicemail this morning, but thought I would follow up with an email in case this was a better way to get in touch. We just moved into a new house and found 5 cats are living under our deck! 2 teen/young adults and 3 young kittens - probaby 5-6 weeks old. Unfortunately we won't be able to let them stay as we have a pet cat that will be moving with us next week, and I'm afraid of territorial battles with the older cats. They have clearly been fed by the previous owners, although they never mentioned the cats to us. I would love to get some help with trapping and relocating them. They are all very skittish but curious and will stay nearby, I think the two older ones would be great barn cats. I'm unsure about the kittens, if they are a family it would be good to keep them all together but that's a lot of barn cats! I would be deferring to your expertise on this. Any help would be appreciated - we are doing construction right now and I don't want to keep scaring them with loud noises and an unsafe environment. MP/ Bridget and I explained everything and I think she understands. She will start trapping for 08/05 clinic.",

Last March a young female wild cat came onto the property and had three kittens. Everything was shut down, so they fed mama and the three kittens and have since given two of the kittens away to other homes. They still have mama and one three month old female kitten (approx. 3.5 mos old now). I can't get a good read on these two cats - they are not wild anymore, they are not stray, but they aren't pets. \nTwo days ago mama cat had five kittens. So the problem grows. So mama and the five kittens are in a cage being fed and watered and they will continue to keep it that way until they can be brought in to be s/n. She says mama and young cat from the first litter are welcome to come back to the property to live - the kittens need to go somewhere else. The Humane Society and Sonoma County Animal Services do not want the cats - AND she cannot afford to pay the $60.00 fee to surrender them. She is a senior citizen living on social security and she wants to get this problem under control but can't afford the cost of surrender. MP.

Laura Nunes sent us an email and I just hung up the phone with her. She lives in a rural section of Petaluma and her backyard backs up onto a property that has several barns on it. The barns are full of junk, and no businesses are run out of them. The cats wander through her property and all through the property with the barns on them. She says her dad is the culprit, he has a business on the other adjacent property and he is the guy who is feeding them. They had a sit down, and she said he needs to either quit feeding them, or pay to have them all spayed and neutered. So he decided to go with his daughter's opinion, hence, this email. So: Laura Nunes is the contact person and she will do the trapping and the transport. Cats: Her best count is 16 of them, ranging in age from teenage cats to adult cats. All black and skinny. No injuries that she can see. There is a new batch of grey kittens, but she wants to get the adults in first. No one handles them or picks them up, her dad feeds them and then they go off. Traps: She needs to pick some up from us and will keep using the same ones until she gets them all in. She will trap on her property. She will release back onto her property. I explained the whole list of services, the cost of $30.00 per cat, days and times we s/n, etc. and she is good for it. MP. I got her scheduled and will get her traps. Very nice.",

By her estimate, they are around one year of age. They have been out there for \"awhile\". She was referred to us by the Humane Society.

She got close to one of them recently and gave it a pat on it's back. That is about all she can do. She needs help trapping - I explained what we do and what it costs and she is all good for that. She asked that if we could help her trap, she will get them in and get them back out onto the property and she will keep feeding them. MP/ When I spoke to her yesterday turns out she has two cats that wondered over as kittens and have been living in her barn. She can handle them so I OK'd bringing them in carriers because we are very short on traps. She said two others come and go.

Many people piped up that they wanted kittens, so I reached out to her. Turns out they’re about 10-12 weeks old, based on the size they were when first spotted, and how much time has gone by. She wasn’t aware of a mama cat, and thought there were 3 babies. She feeds them every night. \nDavid and I went to the site with her to watch her feed. She said she hasn’t seen the kittens lately but the homeless folks there said they’ve seen and heard them. Now, in the last couple days, there are reports of other kittens and some adults (I’m trying to get the info on the other kittens). I’ve attached a map where she’s currently feeding. It’s behind the storage facility at 4420 Sonoma Highway in Santa Rosa, you can see the creek trail. There’s no real access for trapping, and the trail is home to a few folks, one couple who has a pitbull. Mary (the feeder) says the people are keeping the dog leashed and being respectful of the cats. We’ve suggested that she move the feedings 10 feet or so every few days to get closer the the parking lot behind some dental offices, to make it easier to observe and potentially trap. She’s invested in feeding but also works and is stuck with kids at home, and she’s concerned about feeding once it gets darker earlier. MP. They are going to start trapping early October.",

John Davenport lives at 924 Grand Avenue in Santa Rosa - his sister originally called us back in April because a stray cat had come into his yard and had three kittens. We were shut down, the kittens were just born, and his sister said they would just deal with it until we re-opened up. They continued to feed the mama cat and then fed the kittens when they were old enough. One kitten passed, and the other two, a male and female remained. The mama cat and the female kitten have since each had a litter of kittens, and Mr. Davenport is undergoing treatments for cancer and now has a caretaker taking care of him.

Denise asked if we could trap mama cat and any other cats and kittens that we can get. If this something we can do, let me know and I will give Denise a call back and set it in motion.

They (she and her husband) moved into 2070 Pinecrest Avenue in Santa Rosa the day before the 2017 fires (they live in Coffey Park). After the fires, there were two to three cats they assumed were part of the neighborhood. Since then, the group has grown to a point where there are at least a dozen cats, of various ages that hang out in their front yard. They congregate on a tall fence that is shaded by a front yard tree. The group of cats do not go into their backyard as they own a small dog that the cats want nothing to do with. Next door on one side: a neighbor who has a cat, is aware of the situation, and informed Allison this past week that a litter of kittens was born under their (the Thompson's) Jeep parked in front. They have not yet seen the kittens. The adult cats also hang out in their Jeep as it is open with no top to it. Next door on other side: Nice family (Hispanic) who feed the cats, may own some of them, and there is a language barrier. Maybe we can help them out with this too? Allison contacted SCAS who were not the friendliest to them, referred them to us, would not come out, so Allison and her husband are at their wits end. I explained to her that I would send you a report, we would most likely send someone over to see exactly what is going on, and what kind of plan we can have going forward. They realize that some of the cats will be released back to the neighborhood, but there may need to be some relocation also, or adoptions, because the population is growing to a point where it is not manageable. They are not feeding the cats, but their front yard is a complete mess from the smell and the spraying. The cat fights are already making this sleep deprived couple more upset as it goes on",

MP. Trapper Ellen Beckworth. From Jami. They (she and her husband) moved into 2070 Pinecrest Avenue in Santa Rosa the day before the 2017 fires (they live in Coffey Park). After the fires, there were two to three cats they assumed were part of the neighborhood. Since then, the group has grown to a point where there are at least a dozen cats, of various ages that hang out in their front yard. They congregate on a tall fence that is shaded by a front yard tree. The group of cats do not go into their backyard as they own a small dog that the cats want nothing to do with. Next door on one side: a neighbor who has a cat, is aware of the situation, and informed Allison this past week that a litter of kittens was born under their (the Thompson's) Jeep parked in front. They have not yet seen the kittens. The adult cats also hang out in their Jeep as it is open with no top to it. Next door on other side: Nice family (Hispanic) who feed the cats, may own some of them, and there is a language barrier. Maybe we can help them out with this too? Allison contacted SCAS who were not the friendliest to them, referred them to us, would not come out, so Allison and her husband are at their wits end. I explained to her that I would send you a report, we would most likely send someone over to see exactly what is going on, and what kind of plan we can have going forward. They realize that some of the cats will be released back to the neighborhood, but there may need to be some relocation also, or adoptions, because the population is growing to a point where it is not manageable. They are not feeding the cats, but their front yard is a complete mess from the smell and the spraying. The cat fights are already making this sleep deprived couple more upset as it goes on.",

A little bit shorter trail over by La Tortilla. Well marked trail. I went out this morning and sure as **** 34 cats came out to eat. Most looked tame. I brought 6 in today. I'm not ear tipping the tame ones because it will be a deal breaker. Hopefully by the time we get to the wild cats I have be able to convince her this is the best thing for these cats.

Contact #:707-307-9524 She has lived at this location for over one year. She does not know many of her neighbors but is in contact as recently as this morning with our client John Reiche.\nHer other neighbors are past clients of ours: Karen Uber, John Reiche (as mentioned before), Dolores Baughn, Jason Bennett, Mark Belew and Rose Viviani.\nHer immediate neighbor whose first name is Bill (she does not know last name) has traps in his front yard at various spots, some hidden, some not. He has been systematically trapping community cats and relocating them to an unknown spot. Other reports are that he has been poisoning them.\nShe reported the situation to SCAS who let her know that her neighbor is within his legal rights to set rat poison on his own property, and he has the legal right to trap on his own property. She reports that the neighbors are aware that \"Bill\" gives people one chance with a cat, and then they are either killed or relocated. Jamuna reports that she presently has a senior, grey, ear tipped cat in her spare bedroom because he had it trapped on his front porch this morning, in a trap, with no water or food or covering. That was her one chance with this cat.\nJamuna has been in conversation with John Reiche, and their conclusion was to ask us not to release any cats back to this neighborhood after they come thru clinic as they are being killed or relocated. John was feeding a small group of cats besides the ones on his property, and when Jamuna moved in, she took over feeding and caring for them. Of the five originals, one (this grey one in her bedroom) is left. They were mostly middle aged to senior cats, healthy, etc. As recently as Thanksgiving a frail old black cat disappeared. She cannot verify that all of the cats that have disappeared are ear tipped, but she believes John will have a better idea of it. She knows that it is a blend of owned cats, community cats, ear tipped cats, etc. \nJamuna does not seem out of balance, we can speak with John Rieche about the situation if we choose to. John has also been in contact with SCAS. It may be a good idea to call SCAS and see what kind of reports they are actually getting from this area? 707 307 9524.",

From what I can understand, she has taken care of a community stray cat for a while, it is already spayed or neutered, it has been to a vet and has had all the vaccines. The vet just told her the cat was positive for feline leukemia, and she does not know what that is, and she needs some help figuring it out. She said she did not understand what was told to her. My sister Susan called. Said she spoke pretty good English and that she was rude and pushy. Susan conformed it was FIV positive not FeLV. Doc from Heritage said it would be wise to keep inside so it doesn't spread FIV. Susan asked history of cat. A friendly stray she's been caring for for 4 years. Not aggressive. Susan called her back and told her someone will be calling to talk more in-depth about FIV. I am forwarding to Diane to talk with her. 707 623 8060.",

There are “holes” in the foundation which the kitty comes in and out of. I tried to draw a pretty detailed map of where the building is. It is right next to a park & go parking lot. Outside one of the holes of the building there are red bowls where I have been leaving food and water. The kitty is now used to me coming and feeding it at 7:00 am so early morning might be the best time to trap it. Please do not hesitate to call with any questions (707) 696-7513. And please do let me know when you are able to get it so I don’t keep going with food :)\nThank you so much for helping!!\nTami \nJami said she wants to know exactly where to place the trap and any other helpful hints. I called her and said let's meetup Monday. While on the phone she said you're going to keep the cat and I said unfortunately no but will make sure she is spayed or neutered. I said we will assess and if there is placement anywhere I will try and get her in somewhere. Like I tell every other ****** person.

They have him and was reaching out for placement. I was very, very clear that we can not help with placement but she can certainly bring him in for a shave and a haircut and neuter if need be. I have asked Diane to assess temperament and I will do what I can to help with placement elsewhere.

She can do all the trapping, she will pay what she can, she just needs someone to pick them up and deliver them back.

Client will bring cats to us late in day Tuesday 11/15 will send info to clinic staff\n11/11/22 JK Notes from email sent to DF and JC and appts approved:\nJames Pretorius gave a call this morning. He has a ranch he has owned for 35 years at 8201 Westside Potter Valley Road in Potter Valley, but he also owns a one-acre property on Jesse Lane in Petaluma. There is a colony of eight adult cats on his Potter Valley property that he would like to bring to us for spay/neuter. These cats live outside on the ranch, they sleep in the chicken coop in the hay, they are fed in one of the outbuildings every day, but they do not interact with people. \nThe cats are healthy, there are no kittens because the last litter was killed by a mountain lion. There is one older mama cat, the other cats are unknown ****. He has two traps; he has some hard-shell carriers. He did not bat an eye at the donation per cat, and he wants them all ear tipped. They will continue to live on the ranch.\nFor their recovery: At end of clinic, they will go to his property in Petaluma for a couple of days, they will be in one of his four outbuildings, they will be safe and warm and dry. He will take them up to the ranch in Potter Valley and be there for the week following. He has a caretaker on the ranch, but the caretaker became very ill, and that is why they had a colony start because they usually keep a handle on this, but it got away from them. That is why he will be on the ranch after they are transported from Petaluma to Potter Valley for the transition back.\nHe has tried every organization up there, and they either don't call back, they have no space in a clinic, and he even tried to get them into a regular vet but there are no appointments for three months and he says, rightly, there will be two more rounds of kittens by then.\nHe can come by here and pick up some additional traps, he can do it as early as next week, Monday or Wednesday, he just needs a green light from us. Let me know when you can, and I will call him back to schedule - he asked if he could do eight appts so he can do the plan as a whole. If that doesn't work, he will split it up, just let me know. 707 972 3467.",

She has now moved, but goes back with her partner once a day to feed the four cats. She did not end up taking one of the cats with her because of her situation with her dog and not being able to keep them separate in her new apartment. I asked her about her plans to keep mama cat, then take the three kittens to be adopted to RPAS. Did not happen. She posted on Next Door, etc, and had no response. So now we have four cats that she says, need to be trapped and relocated. \nI told her you would give her a call tomorrow with a plan going forward?

Client will borrow trap, no charge, ear tip OK\n1/31/23 AP Client's father, Ernie, came into the office and said he needed to trap 2 young cats (come to find out these are the kittens from June). Will pick up trap early next week. Note: both Ernie and Cesar are really unclear on timelines and go off on tangents often, talking about other cats they have seen around. I told Ernie to remind his son that this cat's microchip still needs to be fixed.\n11/15/22 AP Client called with a very confusing story - the cat that we fixed for him was taken to animal control, and marked as missing, but the information on the chip was for a cat that he had adopted from Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa - picture and all. After some calls to the organization and the microchip company I figured out that Cesar had likely tried to update his adopted cat's microchip himself, but used the MC info from the cat he brought to FFSC instead. I told him the best way to straighten it out was to bring his adopted cat in to scan for a microchip. He was reluctant to do so, saying she would be really scared, then proceeded to refuse to borrow a carrier and intended to bring her loose in the car. I never heard back from him.\n06/23/22 JK Client successful in trapping, brought back the trap, and cats have left the property for somewhere else. \n06/08/22 JK Client and family recently moved to home and discovered a mama cat in the chicken coop, that had a litter of kittens.

Client will bring mama cat in first, then figure out a plan for the kittens. Client will borrow one of our traps for clinic. $40.00 OK Ear tip OK 805 758 0458/707 328 3566.",

By the time we caught him he was very, very swollen and I wasn't even sure he'd make the night. We took him over to Redwood Veterinary Hospital in SR early Sunday morning where Dr. Hoskins was able to sedate him a bit, drain an abscess and give him an antibiotic injection. I have attached the summary to this email for reference. It looks like he in tact, and I am aware that he will need to be neutered before hopefully finding his forever home. However, I'm not sure if the state that he is in would allow for a neuter (I'm sure your vets will make the correct decision, I just wanted to throw it out there that I'd be willing to bring him 2x if necessary since he has an active infection). He is eating and drinking water and looks slightly less puffy, but I know he is still in pain. I am hoping that this path is the compassionate choice, as opposed to euthanasia (which Dr. Hoskins assured me would happen if I signed over the cat to animal control on Sunday). I hope to hear the veterinarian that you work with's opinion on this choice as well. The information you have requested is below; please let me know if more information is needed. I am available by cell or email all day. Again, thank you for the consideration and for getting back to me.\n5/18/21 DF She wants cat relocated; living in her garage for now; can not handle; was told we would try to relo cat when she made appt.

My friend Bo lives there and has his entire life, has always fed the cats as well as his father who owned it before him. I am happy to provide you with his contact information, I just want to get permission from him first. I offered to help him manage the colony, he feeds them everyday and makes sure they have water and shelter but doesn't have the means financially to get them all spayed/neutered/vaxxed,ear tipped etc. I came in for volunteer orientation, and wanted to offer my time to you all with the hopes of getting this colony taken care of. I'm happy to trap the cats myself, and bring them in as well as volunteer at spay days/ other trapping locations / and assist with kittens that need some extra love. I have 5 years vet tech experience from NH, I moved here 4 years ago and havent been practicing since. I was hoping to trade my hours to pay for this colony. There are roughly 20 kittens at this time, probably 6 weeks old and just over 2 pounds at this point, some are all white, eyes are sealed shut, some I believe to be deaf. So I wanted to get the kittens taken care of first. Then go on and trap all the adults. I suppose my questions are mostly about whether yall would take my trade of hours to get this colony managed, and if so and I trap the kittens now- can I bring them to the next clinic day? Then we can make a plan going forward for the adults? She is a lovely human.",

All for four cats.\nThe tenant calls the cats every worst name in the book. She feeds them, I gave her some cans of food to continue feeding them.

Client says she has found homes for some of the kittens. TNR the rest. Message:\nHey there, I’m Danae and I’m currently working with a small colony of cats near my apartments residing by train tracks. I’m located in the Southpoint area of Petaluma. I know you guys are overrun with kittens right now, but I was just wondering if I could get your support on getting these cats fixed. I’ll be trapping/transporting myself and also will be more than happy to take a kitten in myself. I also have some other potential homes for some of the cats. All I’m asking for is some support and help with finding vets willing to spay/neuter these cats at an affordable price, as there are up around 6-8 kittens at the very least. I also have someone willing to donate towards the operation costs. Thank you so much for your time!",

An RV that was in our street left a cat behind as we saw her skinny and looked like breast feeding we decided feed her she was very friendly, soon to find her kittens brought over to our yard we felt sorry for them and opened our side garage door for the 6 kittens and gave them food and water, mamma left and came back with a second litter of 4. Now 2 of the first litter have had kittens(13) and they are Still breast feeding a little but fear they might be pregnant again. We have found homes for a few of them but still remain w/ too many. It would be of sooooo much help if we can set up appointments to have them fixed they are very friendly never bit or scratched us since there mom left them here so young they have gotten used to us and use our doggy door to come in and out of the house and I have kids that couldn’t resist them and played with them all the time as babies. Once wild now tame and looking for affection. We have called places to help and or take them in but they are full no one has been able to help us and some places it’s like a month before a single cat can be seen I don’t know what to do anymore and the cats just keep on having cats and the eldest litter she brought are almost 1yr old and 2 males are spraying my house down so if you can help us with starting with some it would be wonderful. Eldest are almost 1 yr old ? (2 male 2 female), 2nd litter she brought are 5-6 months? (1girl/3boys) New kittens : litter 1 - 2 months (3boys)/ litter 2- 3 months (3girls/2boys) I know they are still a bit young but soon old enough. I am in Petaluma and if I can start with some it would be of great help, thank you.\nIf you can’t get a hold of me becouse my phone is acting up you can call my husband Angel at (415)532-9664 any help would be appreciated.707 205 9336.",

I would say a lot of the cats we see don’t survive, but out here in the dairy district they have so much land to move around, I’m not sure. \nOne cluster of cats, probably 10 or more are fed milk in one of the barns, so they should be easy to access. There are others in the fields that would be a bigger challenge perhaps. Additionally, there are some cats who have befriended the workers who live on property and act as their outdoor pets. One of those had two kittens this past season and they are treated like pets over there. That being said, they are not spayed or neutered. Im not sure if the girl will let me take those or not, but they certainly would still be an issue worth tackling since they live outside and are part of the feral colony. \nStarted with three appts 1/17/24, will add more as client goes thru calendar. Client sent in online request form, says the problem has gone on for years. Wants to do the trapping herself. 925 395 1820.",

I was wondering: my mom is 75, poor w/sight and a falls risk. She lives at 4440 Thomas Rd. in Sebastopol on 4 acres. She has off and on taken care of ferals out there, via feeding them, as they'd usually already been altered by a few other feral cat loving folks who lived nearby. Now, they've all passed on. Sonja was a neighbor who had dozens and dozens of ferals altered by FF, but she has died. Maxine Averbuck was another neighbor who also took care of ferals near my mom's house, but she has died, too. The long and short of it is: my mom now has 3 \"new\" ferals who've showed up at her house and I was wondering if there's a chance FF has a volunteer who can trap them for my mom. My mom says one is young and \"looks\" like a girl. My mom says the other 2 look like boys. \nI live so far away, so can't really assist. Thank you very much, Cory.
